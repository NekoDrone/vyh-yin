# Very Yoosable (useable) Hues (vyh)

vyh is a theme based on [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) that aims to bring variance to some of the flavours the project provides, in particular, Catppuccin Latte and Mocha.

Yin is our take on a less intense light mode theme, while Yang is our take on a less pastel dark mode theme.
